/*
ALGORITHM:
Step 1 − Select the middle item in the array and compare it with the key value to be searched. If it is matched, return the position of the median.

Step 2 − If it does not match the key value, check if the key value is either greater than or less than the median value.

Step 3 − If the key is greater, perform the search in the right sub-array; but if the key is lower than the median value, perform the search in the left sub-array.

Step 4 − Repeat Steps 1, 2 and 3 iteratively, until the size of sub-array becomes 1.

Step 5 − If the key value does not exist in the array, then the algorithm returns an unsuccessful search.
